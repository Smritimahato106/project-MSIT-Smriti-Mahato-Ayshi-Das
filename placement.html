There is a centralized placement team at Techno India Salt Lake where the members regularly monitor every ongoing placement related activity and coordinate with their peers in every unit of TIG to stay informed about the recruitment drive updates.
        
        The placement department of Techno India organizes grooming sessions, soft skill development classes and mock exam interfaces for students to pass with flying colors in the recruitment drives. Techno India leaves no stone unturned in guiding its students for building a glorious professional future.
        
        Engagement in promising job profiles and higher education is paid pivotal importance at Techno India.
